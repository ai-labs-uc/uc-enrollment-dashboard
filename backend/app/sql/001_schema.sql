-- UC Enrollment Geography Dashboard — schema
-- PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS 3.4
--
-- Design notes
--   * The GeoPackages are treated as GEOMETRY SOURCES ONLY. Every count served by the
--     API is recomputed from the enrollment table, because the shipped municipal layer
--     was joined on municipality name alone and is inflated (see docs/DATA-AUDIT.md).
--   * A municipality is identified by (name, province). Name alone is not unique in the
--     Philippines — "Rosario" exists in five provinces in this dataset.
--   * Two metrics are exposed separately and never conflated:
--       headcount           = COUNT(DISTINCT student_ref)
--       enrollment_records  = COUNT(*)
